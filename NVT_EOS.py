#   Software Name: NVT_EOS.py
#   Brief Description: Script to compute the density-pressure equation
#    of state from a particle-number probability distribution. This
#    method yields an isotherm that contains stable, metastable, and
#    unstable state points.
#   Author: Daniel W. Siderius, PhD
#   Contact Information: daniel.siderius@nist.gov
#
#   Computation of the equation of state is based on a method discussed by
#    Shen and Errington in J. Phys. Chem. B, 108(51):19595-19606, (2004).
#    The method is presented on page 19598 in equations 12-19.

#   Version: 1.0
#   Release Date: 27 August 2012
